# aA-ruby-test
 testing my ruby 
I will go through each of the practice problems I solved during aA intro class to Ruby. 
Rules: 
1. Cant't look at solution or any walkthroughs.
2. Can't look at any notes I made or google.
3. Can not edit code after I test, only can fix if simple typo.

RESULTS:
Passed 61/79 without looking at notes, the other 18 all are functional, I just had to look at my notes to make it work. I am pleased with this and will continue to work with Ruby and learn about Ruby on Rails next.
